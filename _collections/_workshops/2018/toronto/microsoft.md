title: Stateful serverless with Azure Functions
company: Microsoft
---

In this workshop we'll learn about Durable Functions, an extension of Azure Functions that allows us to define stateful workflows in a serverless environment. It does so by managing state, checkpoints and restarting when needed. Function chaining, Fan-out/Fan-in and other complex serverless patterns now become part of framework and are easy to integrate in our applications.
