One of the best things about using a new technology ecosystem is watching it evolve quickly and try to meet the needs of a new wave of interested developers. One of the toughest? Finding, building, and sometimes using the development and debugging tooling around that technology-- and FaaS is no exception. In this talk, we'll take a look at issues that make FaaS unique when it comes to building developer tools, and take a look at ways these issues are being tackled -- by parties both internal and external to FaaS providers.
