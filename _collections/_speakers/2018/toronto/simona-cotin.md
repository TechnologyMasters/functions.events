talk: Build Scalable APIs using GraphQL and Serverless 
bio: >
  I fell in love with coding 15 years ago. Ever since I have hacked all kinds of projects in C/C++, Delphi, C#, PHP, Java, Python, Lisp, Javascript and hoping to learn Go this year. I started my career writing Delphi for Rad Studio at Borland (or Embarcadero). While working for Corvil and Arista Networks, developed a passion for data analytics platforms and network data as well as Angular with Typescript (right before it became super popular).

Current trends in software and backend architecture have been evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. I am sure most of you have heard of microservice based architectures. The latest development on that front in the past couple of years has been the advent of serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint. GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook.
