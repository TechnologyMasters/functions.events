talk: Automate the Deployment of Security Controls for Serverless Apps
bio: 
---

Most fundamental security practices and controls apply to serverless applications, including implementing proper monitoring and logging of all requests and events. The session will cover recommendations published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and how to automate the deployment of some of these controls with Infrastructure as Code tools. The CIS benchmarks provide a solid starting point, with consensus-based configuration guidelines developed by experts in government, business, industry and academia. The session will cover the latest CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and how accounts and environments can be hardened. Beyond monitoring and logging, the session also covers code and data-flow vulnerabilities, with examples, for which rules and controls cannot be easily automated.
