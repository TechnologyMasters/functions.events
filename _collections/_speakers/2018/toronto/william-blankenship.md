Software engineers occupy a critical position when it comes to a company's reputation. Many customers engage with our brands exclusively through the systems that we build. The changes we introduce to those systems have a direct impact on our customer's perception of our brand. By managing and de-risking those changes, we can ensure that we continue to deliver an exceptional experience and we can yield happy paying customers.
