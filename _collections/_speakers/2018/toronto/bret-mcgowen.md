Kubernetes lets you orchestrate containers for a wide variety of workloads: from on premise data centers to hyperscale clouds to Raspberry Pi clusters. But it still requires knowledge of containers and significant manual configuration, even for application developers. Knative is a collaborative project from Google, IBM, Pivotal, Red Hat and more to create Kubernetes-based serverless building blocks like building, eventing, and serving. Learn why we started this project and how it's being used to create serverless development experiences for startups, enterprises, ERP developers and more.
