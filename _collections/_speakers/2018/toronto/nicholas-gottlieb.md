Organizations that want to move fast, reduce overhead, and innovate more are increasingly adopting serverless architectures. The gains in speed and productivity from adopting these architectures are significant, but they’re not without risk, and one of these risks is losing agility due to lock-in. In the talk we’ll discuss architectural strategies that organizations can adopt to optimize for agility and vendor choice while still reaping the benefits of highly abstracted serverless services. The strategies we will discuss include utilizing open source technologies, adopting open standards, building an event-driven architectures to avoid data lock-in, and more. We will reference real strategies implemented by companies like Coca-Cola, Accenture, and Expedia.
